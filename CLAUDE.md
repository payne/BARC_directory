# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This directory contains a PDF document for the Bellevue Amateur Radio Club (BARC) member directory dated June 24, 2025. This is not a software development project but rather a document repository containing amateur radio club member information.

## File Structure

- `BARC_directory_06_24_2025.pdf` - Member directory containing contact information, call signs, and ARRL membership status for approximately 90+ club members

## Document Content

The PDF contains a comprehensive member directory with:
- Member names and photos
- Physical addresses (primarily in Bellevue, Papillion, Omaha, and surrounding Nebraska areas)
- Contact information (phone numbers, email addresses)
- Amateur radio call signs
- ARRL membership status
- Club office positions (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, etc.)

## Working with This Repository

Since this is a document repository rather than a code repository:
- No build, test, or lint commands are applicable
- No development dependencies or frameworks are used
- Document viewing/editing would require PDF tools rather than code editors
- Version control would be document-based rather than code-based

## Notes

- This appears to be a club membership management document
- Contains personal contact information that should be handled with appropriate privacy considerations
- The directory shows the club has various officer positions including past presidents, current officers, and general members
